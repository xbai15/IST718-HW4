Short code snippets are allowed from the internet.  Code from the class text books or class provided code can be copied in its entirety.__\n- There could be tests in some cells (i.e., `assert` and `np.testing.` statements). These tests (if present) are used to grade your answers. **However, the professor and FAs could use __additional__ test for your answer. Think about cases where your code should run even if it passess all the tests you see.**\n- Before submitting your work, remember to check for run time errors with the following procedure:\n`Kernel`$\\rightarrow$`Restart and Run All`.  All runtime errors will result in a minimum penalty of half off.\n- Data Bricks is the official class runtime environment so you should test your code on Data Bricks before submission.  If there is a runtime problem in the grading environment, we will try your code on Data Bricks before making a final grading decision.\n- All plots shall include descriptinve title and axis labels.  Plot legends shall be included where possible.  Unless stated otherwise, plots can be made using any Python plotting package.  It is understood that spark data structures must be converted to something like numpy or pandas prior to making plots.  All required mathematical operations, filtering, selection, etc., required by a homework question shall be performed in spark prior to converting to numpy or pandas.\n- Grading feedback cells are there for graders to provide feedback to students.  Don't change or remove grading feedback cells.\n- Don't add or remove files from your git repo.\n- Do not change file names in your repo.  This also means don't change the title of the ipython notebook.\n- You are free to add additional code cells around the cells marked `your code here`.\n- We reserve the right to take points off for operations that are extremely inefficient or \"heavy weight\".  This is a big data class and extremely inefficient operations make a big difference when scaling up to large data sets.  For example, the spark dataframe collect() method is a very heavy weight operation and should not be used unless it there is a real need for it.  An example where collect() might be needed is to get ready to make a plot after filtering a spark dataframe.\n- import * is not allowed because it is considered a very bad coding practice and in some cases can result in a significant delay (which slows down the grading process) in loading imports.  For example, the statement `from sympy import *` is not allowed.  You must import the specific packages that you need.\n- If you perform databricks specific operations, you MUST protect those operations in an if statement by calling the is_databricks() function provided in all homework assignments.  For example, if you use dbutils (databricks utilities), only run dbutils commands if is_databricks() returns true.  Runtime errors created in the grading environment by not protecting databricks specific commands in an if statement will result in a runtime error points deduction. \n- The graders reserve the right to deduct points for subjective things we see with your code.  For example, if we ask you to create a pandas data frame to display values from an investigation and you hard code the values, we will take points off for that.  This is only one of many different things we could find in reviewing your code.  In general, write your code like you are submitting it for a code peer review in industry.  \n- Level of effort is part of our subjective grading.  Oftentimes there is a large disparity between the level of effort between students who are trying learn, and students who are trying to do the minimum possible to check off an assignment requirement.  For example, in cases where we ask for a more open ended investigation, some students put in significant effort and some students do the minimum possible to meet requirements.  In these cases, we may take points off for students who did not put in much effort as compared to students who did put in a lot of effort.  We feel that the students who did a better job deserve a better grade.  We reserve the right to invoke level of effort grading at any time.\n- Only use spark, spark machine learning, spark data frames, RDD's, and map reduce to solve all problems unless instructed otherwise.\n- Unless code is provided which reads data files, __you must use the get_training_filename function povided below to read data files.\"  Runtime errors encountered while grading caused by students not using get_training_filename will result in a minimum of half points off for the problem in question.__"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Do not delete or change this cell\n\nenable_grid = True\n\n# grading import statements\n%matplotlib inline\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nfrom pyspark.sql import SQLContext\nspark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()\nsc = spark.sparkContext\nsqlContext = SQLContext(sc)\nimport os\n\n# Define a function to determine if we are running on data bricks\n# Return true if running in the data bricks environment, false otherwise\ndef is_databricks():\n    # get the databricks runtime version\n    db_env = os.getenv(\"DATABRICKS_RUNTIME_VERSION\")\n    \n    # if running on data bricks\n    if db_env != None:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Define a function to read the data file.
